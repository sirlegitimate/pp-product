			<p>This website is part of my Personal Project, a special assignment in which I had to learn something significant by myself that would support my future development as an IB learner. It is not intended to make a profit but to demonstrate my newfound knowledge of JavaScript. The game is primarily dedicated to children (8-10-year-olds), but this info page is meant to be read by those reviewing the website (If you're reading this, thank you for your commitment!).</p>
			<p>PS: Yes, I'm aware that the levels are somewhat unintuitive. Still, the whole point of this assignment was for me to learn a new coding language, not to improve my teaching skills with 8-year-olds.</p>

			<p>Over the last 2 months or so, I’ve been trying to learn how to program in JavaScript from scratch, following various tutorials as well as trying to program an entire game by myself. As this is a part of my Personal Project, I’d like to share my experience with you, including all of the notes I have made for myself in my PP notebook (yes, I did get a separate notebook for that) as well as all of the mistakes I have made along the way, in case you felt inspired by my project and wanted to learn JavaScript yourself.</p>
			<p>Here are the main points you should consider when learning JS:	</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The Internet has all of the information you would ever need.</strong></li>
				<p>Before I started the project, I ordered a couple of books from Allegro related to JS and web design, thinking that I would need to read all of that to get anywhere. As it turned out though, it was nothing but a waste of money, as the Internet is a much better source of information than any book you could buy, at least if you know how to look for said information.</p>
				<p>The best source of Information throughout the project was the video tutorial made by freeCodeCamp.org <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg">(www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg)</a>. It was very straight-to-the-point, steamrolling through various topics by providing a quick explanation and an example for each, much shorter than the other tutorials but still covering everything you would need to start programming. Moreover, all of the topics were clearly labelled with timestamps and brief title screens, requiring very little clarification in the long run as I didn’t have to have any other outside information to follow through with most of the tutorial.</p>
				<p>Of course, as things got more complicated, I had to look at other sources as well, which is when I found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> to be the best overall source of information. It is like a search engine but for terms related to programming, being the most useful when you don’t know what a particular element means or does. Then again, if you need extra clarification, the website provides a very detailed analysis of each element, with it also providing an example for a multitude of use cases. It is also great when trying to work with multiple languages.</p>
				<p>The third source might be quite controversial, often being misused by students, but I find punishment for using it as a very naive and misinformed decision, as it is a great research tool with a lot of legitimate use cases. I am talking about <a href="https://chatgpt.com">chatgpt.com</a>, which is very useful when trying to solve a problem with your code (debugging), especially if you don’t have the faintest idea as to where it’s coming from. It saved me a lot of time, allowing me to figure a lot of stuff out much earlier, which is why I recommend using it in cases where you need to find something specific, as long as you’re not actively copying from it. It isn’t good at writing code, overcomplicating it when it isn’t necessary, which is why you should always try to write your own code.</p>
				<li><strong>Sometimes, simpler solutions are not the best option.</strong></li>
				<p>I remember how I tried to keep things simple in my code, trying to use a simple text editor like SublimeText to write my code as well as avoiding JSON and SessionStorage as I thought I wouldn’t need them, but in the end, these decisions ended up with me wasting hours of my time trying to get those ‘simpler’ solutions to work.</p>
				<p>As I tried to transfer information between files, wanting to send a piece of data between the game menu and the game window, it didn’t let me send any of that due to some restrictions that most browsers have relating to websites stored on computers. I ended up wasting 4 hours trying to get it working on my file system, using import/export or handles in links, but in the end, I had to abandon SublimeText and go for the much more advanced <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code.</a></p>
				<p>After doing that, I installed the LiveServer extension and set the type of JS files referenced in my HTML files to module (which circumvented the browser restrictions from before), but I still tried to get import/export to work, despite me hearing about Session Storage. I ended up wasting another hour, before I ultimately ended up making notes on sessionStorage (temporary cookies) and JSON (a format for storing and transporting data), which allowed me to finally transfer data between the to websites.</p>
				<p>Looking back, I feel really stupid for trying a few select options over and over again and I don’t want any of you to repeat the same mistake. Here, what seemed more complicated was the only option, which is why you should try out multiple different options in a situation like this rather than trying to cut corners.</p>
				<li><strong>Spread out your work and carefully consider your expectations.</strong></li>
				<p>This was one of my main mistakes from the beginning, with the expectations I set out for myself being too high, resulting in me having to lower them over time. I wanted to make a game with multiple different subjects (not just math), with intractable characters, and a leaderboard visible to all players, but that was way beyond what I could manage to do in one and a half months, especially as most of those would have required not only a lot more knowledge in JS but some experience in an entirely different coding language as well as a lot more knowledge in CSS, something I didn't have the time for.</p>
				<p>I started my PP early, which is why I still managed to adjust my project a long time after it started, but it is still important to manage your expectations when it comes to programming. You'll only know whether something more advanced would be possible for you after you go over the basics, with me deciding that the more advanced stuff had to be cut out, as it was too much to handle all at once. If you plan on programming yourself, set out your goals so that they can be adjusted in the future, unlike me, where I had to abandon many of the concepts I had thought up simply because they were beyond my abilities.</p>
				<p>That doesn't mean you can't try; in fact, it'd be better if you pushed on, but in the beginning, this will be the case for everything, as you learned the concepts yourself but didn't know how to express them. If you do plan on being more ambitious, space out your work in a way that it'll leave you some free time, as learning how to program is a long process, something which I sadly couldn't do because of the terrible school system but something that you can probably do if it's not forced upon you.</p>
			</ol>
			<p>I hope you found these recommendations helpful. Still, if you plan to learn how to program yourself, you'll experience many different things along the way. I have posted all of my notes on JS (the code that can make a website do something on its own) below, with some extra ones from HTML (the structuring of the website) and a little bit of CSS (the graphic design of the website). Thank you for reviewing my website.</p>
